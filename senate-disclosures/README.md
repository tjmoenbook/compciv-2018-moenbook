# Final project summary

My idea for a report on Senate finance disclosures is to look at how many senators have asked for extensions to their disclosures.  A visualization idea is to show a graph of number of extensions by year.  And also to break it down and also to break it down by party (i.e. Republicans vs Democratic)

Sanders misses financial disclosure filing deadline -

	It's not unusual for senators to miss the deadline. Sanders's early months in the presidential campaign are covered by his 2015 financial disclosure, and a spokesman told The Hill the extension is "routine."
	But the missed deadline means a further delay on a snapshot of his 2016 finances after extra time granted throughout his presidential campaign by the Federal Election Commission (FEC).
