# Final project summary

My idea for a report on Senate finance disclosures is to look at how many times the Senators from the state of Washington have exchanged assets over $1000 between 2012 and 2018.  A visualization idea is to show a graph of number of exchanges by year.  And also to break it down by Senator.
